Description: CODATA internationally recommended values of the fundamental physical 
    constants, provided as symbols for direct use within the R language. Optionally, 
    the values with errors and/or the values with units are also provided if the 
    'errors' and/or the 'units' packages are installed. The Committee on Data
    for Science and Technology (CODATA) is an interdisciplinary committee of the
    International Council for Science which periodically provides the internationally 
    accepted set of values of the fundamental physical constants. This package 
    contains the "2014 CODATA" version, published on 25 June 2015:
